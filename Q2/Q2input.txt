There has been a lot of improvement in the status of women in India after the independence. Gradually women started enjoying equality with men in the society. Women have all the rights and privileges in every areas as possessed by the men. The Constitution of India has given equal rights, privileges and freedom that are enjoyed by the men for years. Even after various exploitation against women, they are now feeling much emancipated and free. Almost half area and population in India is covered by the women so the development of the country depends upon the status of both sex equally. We can imagine that time when 50% of the population was not given equal opportunities and rights and even restricted to perform many activities in the society. Now-a-days, women are getting top positions in various fields of life such as some have been great political leaders, social reformers, entrepreneurs, business personalities, administrators, etc.

Improvement in the status of women changes the social and economic status of the country. Status of women in the Indian society is much better than the women in other developing countries. However, it is not enough to say that status of women have been completely improved in India. In such a competitive world, Indian women are being well conscious about their rights and privileges in various fields. They are being more conscious about their professional career (socially, politically, economically and educationally) by following their all the responsibilities towards family.
